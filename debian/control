Description: Extract page mode and named destinations as PDFmark from PDF
 When you create a PDF document using a TeX system, you may include
 many small PDF files in the main PDF file. It is common for each of
 those files to use the same fonts.
 .
 If the small PDF files contain embedded font subsets, the TeX system
 includes them as-is in the main PDF. As a result, several subsets of
 the same font are embedded in the main PDF. It is not possible to
 remove the duplicates since they are different subsets. This vastly
 increases the size of the main PDF file.
 .
 On the other hand, if the small PDF files contain embedded full font
 sets, the TeX system also includes all of them in the main PDF.
 This time, the main PDF contains duplicates of the same full sets of
 fonts. Therefore, Ghostscript can remove the duplicates. This may
 considerably reduce the main PDF-file's size.
 .
 Finally, if the small PDF files contain some fonts that are not
 embedded, the TeX system outputs the main PDF file with some fonts
 missing. In this case, Ghostscript can embed the necessary fonts.
 It can significantly reduce the required disk size.
 .
 Either way, when Ghostscript reads the main PDF produced by the
 TeX system and outputs the final PDF it does not preserve PDF
 page-mode and named-destinations etc. As a result, when you open
 the final PDF, it is not displayed correctly. Also, remote PDF
 links will not work.
 .
 This program is able to extract page mode and named destinations
 as PDFmark from PDF. By using this you can get the small PDF files
 that have preserved them.
